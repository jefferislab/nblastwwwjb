#NBLAST: Rapid, sensitive comparison of neuronal structure and construction of neuron family databases
Neural circuit mapping efforts in model organisms are generating multi-terabyte datasets of 10,000s of labelled neurons. Such data demand new computational tools to search and organize neurons. We present a general, sensitive and rapid algorithm, NBLAST, for measuring pairwise neuronal similarity. NBLAST considers both position and local geometry and works by decomposing a query and target neuron into short segments; matched segment pairs are scored using a log-likelihood ratio scoring matrix empirically defined by the statistics of real matches and non-matches.
