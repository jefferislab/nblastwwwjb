We have used affinity propagation clustering of our NBLAST scores to cluster the full FlyCircuit dataset of 16,129 neurons into 1,052 distinct clusters of highly related neurons. These clusters have been organised into superclusters, enabling both exploration of the dataset and the matching of individual clusters to morphological types reported in the literature. 

You can browse these superclusters and the clusters within it [here](http://jefferislab.org/si/nblast/clusters/). Each supercluster is detailed on its own page, including an interactive 3D model and links to the clusters.

Each cluster page has information on the constituent neurons and similar clusters as determined by NBLAST.
