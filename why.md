NBLAST allows you to search for similar neurons in a variety of ways. You can use a whole neuron or a fragment of a neuron as a query, and find neurons that match it.

Another possibility is to use a tracing of a neuron, part of an expression pattern or clone to run a query.

You can also search the FlyLight GAL4 lines for the ones that include your query neuron.

Default searches are run against the 16,129 neurons of the FlyCircuit dataset, but you can also use your own data. For more information, have a look at the [video demos](../demos).
