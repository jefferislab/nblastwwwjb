NBLAST allows you to search for similar neurons in a variety of ways. You can use a whole neuron or a fragment of a neuron as a query, and find neurons that match it.

Another possibility is to use a tracing, for example, from an expression pattern or clone to run a query and find similar neurons.

Searches can be run on the 16,129 neurons or the FlyCircuit dataset, or on your own data. You can, for example, use your own tracing of a neuron to find FlyCircuit neurons that match it.
