We have developed a simple web-app for comparing neurons using our NBLAST algorithm. [NBLAST on-the-fly](http://jefferislab.org/si/nblast/on-the-fly/) allows you to compare FlyCircuit neurons against one another and against your own uploaded tracings, with interactive 3D display, from the comfort of your browser.

Look at the video demos [here](../demos/#nblast-online) to see how to use the app.
