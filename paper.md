A pre-print version of the NBLAST paper is currently available from the [bioRxiv: Costa et al. NBLAST: Rapid, sensitive comparison of neuronal structure and construction of neuron family databases](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/006346).

Full source code for the figures presented in the paper is available on the [jefferislab/NBLAST_figures](https://github.com/jefferislab/NBLAST_figures/) github repository.
Full instructions of how to run the code are available in the repository [README](https://github.com/jefferislab/NBLAST_figures/blob/master/README.md).
